# Dataset Entropy Tool
 A python tool designed to analyse the amount and types of entropy in a dataset.

## What is this?
A tool I have built specifically for testing different types of entropy in a dataset and performing statistical analysis in cutting-edge, useful ways for my research.

## Why develop this tool?
This code is part of my earthquake forecasting project, a tool I'm developing to incorporate as just a small part of my research.

## Can I use this tool for my own projects?
Absolutely, please go ahead and use it. You may need to modify it to suite your needs.
